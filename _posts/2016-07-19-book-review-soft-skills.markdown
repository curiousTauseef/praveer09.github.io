I started year 2016 with reading a book that I came across while I was searching for a book that would benefit me 
as a developer. I am glad I read this book. This book has not only helped me professionally, but also personally. This 
is one of the most practical books that I have ever come across. The only reason that I am writing this book review is that 
I have benefited a lot from this book and by spreading the word around about this book, I might help someone benefit from it. 

The book that I am talking about is [Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual][book] by [John Z. Sonmez][john]. 
If you read the foreword written by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) for this book, you will get to know how John
himself follows what all he has written in the book. 

The book has been divided into seven sections. There are multiple chapters within each section. Each chapter is an easy 
read. When I was reading this book, I could read each chapter in 5 to 10 minutes. I will be highlighting the things 
from each of the sections that have benefited me the most. If you see the sections below, you will understand why John calls 
this book **a life manual**. In his book, John starts each section with a quote which very beautifully summarizes the section. 
I will be mentioning those quotes against each section.

### Career

am on the correct path.

### Productivity

This is one section that gave me a lot of knowledge how to manage my time and become more productive. Some things 
that I learnt are:

- Using the **pomodoro technique** to my advantage

real estate.

### Fitness

Those who know me may understand how much this section would have helped me. 
- One of the best lessons I learnt was how to **make exercises fun**. An example that I am taking from the book is that if you 
love to read books, then you can combine it with your running by listening to an audiobook while running. 
- I learnt some food hacks that will satisfy your stomach when it wants the most but without adding anything to your belly. 

### Spirit

take me a long way in my life.
