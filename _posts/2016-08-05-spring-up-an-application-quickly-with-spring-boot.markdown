I have created a video, in which I show how easy it is to spring up an application quickly 
with [Spring Boot](SpringBoot).

Spring Boot does this by using multiple frameworks and tools, both from Springâ€™s ecosystem and outside, 
and combining them with sensible configurations. As a result decisions around concerns like logging, 
monitoring, externalized configuration, packaging and running applications, etc are already taken care 
of and a developer can immediately start working on building the business logic.
